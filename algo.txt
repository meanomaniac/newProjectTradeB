Repeat all the following steps for each symbol in every exchange.
Save all the following values/times as form of variables that you can alter to do multiple tests on.

1
  a) Start from the first (or n) tracking status (we will repeat the following few steps for every available subsequent tracking status)
  b) Calculate the tracking status (TS) 15 mins from then (15 *2 = 30 with the 30 s time gap u are currently using).
     If you cannot find the exact 15th min (n + 180 TS) look for +1 TS. If you still cant find look for -1TS. If you still
     cant find it look for +2 TS and then -2TS. Repeat this until +-5 mins (+- 10 TS). If you cant find anything ignore it.
  c) If you find the 15th or so minute, move to the next step (step 2) Then Repeat the above 2 steps for the next 15 min interval.
    If you didn't find the 90+-15min in the previous step, then start step 1 a) over again starting from the next available timepoint
    after Pt. A + 15 mins, i.e. start from the first available TS that is greater than  Pt A's TS + 30.

2
  a) get the difference between the last and the first point of the 15 min interval. The first point is Pt. A
  b) If the difference is more than 5%, then move to next, else go back to step 1 and reset peak tracking
  c) Repeat Step 1 until step 2 b) ceases to be more than 5%. This is Pt B.
  d) If the difference between point Pt. A and Pt. B is more than 40%, move to next, else reset peak tracking. Steps 1 and 2
    entail the peak find function. Make a similar dip finding function. This function that simply returns a 40 % peak or not
    can be called by another function that runs on as a setInterval and calls steps 3 and 4; as well as by other functions in an
    ad hoc manner as you will see in the following steps to get peaks when desired.
    The set Interval function when finds a peak calls the 3rd step.

3
  a) check if at +3 hrs (+180 min or 360 TS - repeat step 1 b to get a close enough time
  if needed) the price has stayed within margin of error (2%). This is Pt. C. If so move to next.
  b) Go through each TS between Pt. B and Pt.C. They should stay within Margin of error (2%).
    Two or three exceptions are ok (dip for a short time but coming back up is ok). Ensure the last few (like 10) TSs do not
    include such dips/exceptions. If so move, initiate a buy and move to next.
4
  a) Start from the Pt C and repeat Steps 1 and 2 to find a peak more than 40%.
  b) Continue step 4 a) and repeat this step until either the result is true or you reach
    Pt. C + 24 hrs (+60*2*24 TSs)
  c) If result of step 4 a) or 4 b) is true then initiate Sale at market price. This is Pt. D
